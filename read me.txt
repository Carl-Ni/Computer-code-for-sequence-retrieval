The code is written in MATLAB, we usually run the code on MATLAB R2021a and in windows 10 operation system.
The package contains two functions,detail instructions are described below.
(1)
Function name : seqAll = findBindingSequences(positionGet, PAO1, sequenceLength,dirSave)
Description of the function: this function extract DNA sequences near SNP sites in the PAO1 genome. We usually listed all the SNPs obtained through genome sequencing in the nx1 vector positionGet. 
The generated text file is named 'mutationSeqInfo.txt'and saved in the custom-defined dirSave folder. This 'mutationSeqInfo.txt' file can be directly uploaded to the MEME website, and users can then 
obtain TF binding motifs using MEME. sequenceLength is a varialbe that define the length of the retrieved sequence, usually set as 200, that is, 100 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of the SNP site.
PAO1 is a matrix that downloaded from the PAO1 database that was already included in the package £¨PAO1_fasta_annotation£©. Before using this function, users should drag the PAO1 file into MATLAB workspace.

(2)
Function name: [outPutLogic,locusTagGet,locusTagGet2,promoterStateGet] = promoterDecision(positionGet,PAO1)
Description of the function: this function determine whether a SNP is situated at the promoter region of a gene. The input variable 'positionGet' is an nx1 vector contains positions of SNPs in the genome. 
The output varialbe 'promoterStateGet' is also an nx1 vector that describe the state of corresponding SNPs in 'positionGet'. There are five cases in 'promoterStateGet':
case 1#, promoterStateGet=1, the corresponding SNP is situated in a forward promoter;
case 2#, promoterStateGet=2, the corresponding SNP is situated in a reverse promoter;
case 3#, promoterStateGet=3, the corresponding SNP is situated in a bi-directional promoter;
case 4#, promoterStateGet=4, the corresponding SNP is situated in a non-promoter intergenic region;
case 5#, promoterStateGet=0, the corresponding SNP is situated in a coding sequence;
PAO1 is a matrix that downloaded from the PAO1 database that was already included in the package £¨PAO1_fasta_annotation£©. Before using this function, users should drag the PAO1 file into MATLAB workspace.
